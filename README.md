# aws-terraform-module-openvpn-byol
---

This project is part of our open source DevOps adoption approach. 

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

This module deploys ready-to-go OpenVPN Access Server AMI with an RDS backend and Letsencrypt for SSL certificate generation.

The module requires the following:
* `terraform` version >= 0.12.0
* `aws` provider ~> 2.7
* OpenVPN Access Server AMI (we recommend building it with [Codebuild](https://github.com/osodevops/aws-terraform-module-codebuild-packer))

### How does it work?

The OpenVPN server sits inside of a autoscaling group and is deployed into public subnet within a nominated VPC in order to ring-fence the solution. VPN client users can connect to the OpenVPN server creating a dedicated layer 4 tunnels which the VPN users can then use to access internal services hosted in the nominated VPC or in adjacent VPC attached via VPC-peering. The OpenVPN server can also provide access to any internal Route53 hosted zone by DNS proprigation. Access to the OpnVPN server for administrative tasks can be done either through the admin GUI on port 943 or via the AWS System Manager, which creates an SSH session via the AWS console. Port 22 is not open on this server, access directly via SSH is not enabled for improved protection against attackers, we recommend to all our clients to use AWS Session Manager instead, to find out more please see the [following page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html).

In this solution OpenVPN Access Server is configured to migrate its local SQLite database to Aurora RDS to allow for data persistance, the migration process is fully automated using Ansible playbooks which are stored in S3 and are generated during the Terraform run. These Ansible playbooks are later pulled down from S3 and run locally as part of the user-data boot procedure. This means that the no matter what happens to the EC2 instance the AutoScalingGroup will replace it with a new instance and during the boot up sequence of that instance, Ansible will check if it needs to migrate the database or update the configuration file on the EC2 instance to ensure OpenVPN Access Server is using the database stored in Aurora RDS. The ansible playbooks will also generate SSL certificates everytime a new EC2 instance is deployed and store the ceritifcates in S3 so they can be pulled down again and reused in case a new instance needs to be spun up. 

Since developing this solution, Letsencrypt have reduced the longevity of thier SSL certificates, we now recommend terminating your EC2 instance on a regular basis allow for Letsencrypt to generate a new certificate.
